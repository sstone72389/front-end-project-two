Explanation of project: This application’s purpose is to provide a means of organization to the user. As per the title suggests: it is to help keep one on track in their day to day life. This will be achieved via user input and interaction with the app. A user will be able to monitor their day to tasks and use an interactive ‘reminders’ checklist to ensure they ‘did not forget’ a desired activity or action. Users will be able to manipulate the data that they input as desired tasks and to acquire data about previously completed tasks or tasks that have not yet been completed.
