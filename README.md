Explanation of project: This application’s purpose is to provide a means of organization to the user. As per the title suggests: it is to help keep one on track in their day to day life. This will be achieved via user input and interaction with the app. A user will be able to monitor their day to tasks and use an interactive ‘reminders’ checklist to ensure they ‘did not forget’ a desired activity or action. Users will be able to manipulate the data that they input as desired.

How it works: This app uses a rails back-end to store data and communicate with the front -end/client-side (see link to rails-api repo for further information). The front-end is composed of JS, HTML, CSS (including SASS and bootstrap). It also utilizes handlebars to display data in a readable format to the client.

Approach taken when building: Planning was key, here. I started by creating wireframes and user stories. The next step for me was to build a basic HTML/CSS template that will provide a responsive user experience. From there, the next step was to build the back-end so and test via CURL scripts to ensure functionality. Once confirmed, I was able to move to the fron end and create proper user interactions.

Unsolved problems: I would like this app to look more like a 'reminders' list. That said, I would like to incorporate animations/applicable buttons and JS to allow for a smoother user experience. Not using ID's for editing and removal is my main priority on refactor.

User Stories:

* As a user, I want to be able to sign up for an account.
* As a user, I want to be able to log into my account.
* As a user, I want to be able to log out of my account.
* As a user, I want to be able to change my password.
* As a user, I want to be able to input a task to the checklist.
* As a user, I want to be able to remove a task.
* As a user, I want to be able to view tasks at all times (if they exist).
* As a user, I want to be able to modify a task.
